# Ranjana Script

The Newa language, or  Nepal Bhasa, has been written for a thousand years in a total of nine closely-related scripts: Ranjana, Bhujinmol, Kunmol, Kwenmol, Pachumol, Hinmol, Golmol, Litumol, and Prachalit Nepal. Collectively, these scripts are called Nepal Lipi.

Ranjana known as Kutila or Lantsa.

Ranjana, whose name is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning “joyful,” is the boldest and most widely visible, seen in almost every temple, stupa or monastery in Nepal, and still used for reciting sutras and mantras. It has also been seen as a holy text that will bring good fortune to the home and protect it from negative energies. An inherently calligraphic script, it is written with a clear stroke form, angled at 25-30 degrees, and each letter is seen as consisting of a head, a backbone, a tail, and in many cases a hand or torso. Ranjana can be written in both horizontal and vertical (or “monogram”) forms. The latter is called kutakshar, or “secret writing,” and was traditionally used to write sutras or to send secret messages, presumably because each word is so highly condensed and interwoven it is harder to decipher.
